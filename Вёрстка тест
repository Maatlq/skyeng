<p>I remember when I was about eight or nine, I had a pet. It was my first pet, actually, and it was a little budgie called Ollie. 
I named her Ollie because it was the year of the Olympics … I can't remember which year it was. But this bird was really unusual because, quite quickly she became very tame. 
And I used to come home from school and I'd pick her up off whatever she was perching and I'd take her upstairs  and she'd sit on the side of the bed. 
I don't know what actually happened to her because one day,  we all got so used to just her being round the house,  that one day my mother came in with some washing, 
the back door was open, and she just flew off and, er, we never found her again. It's a bit sad, really …</p>

<p>The boat started floating out towards the sea and also, at the same time, the weather changed. It became very windy and the sea got choppy and we were quite scared. 
So, when we looked in the boat, the radio didn't work, so we couldn't ask for any help. We thought we were gonna be stuck here all night because we had no way of contacting anybody.
But in the end, it was OK because my girlfriend managed  to find the telephone number of the people who gave us the boat, so, after about half an hour maybe, 
they came and rescued us, but at the time it was, er, we were very worried and very scared.</p>

<p>It was a time when I was really frightened and  it was about two years ago,  when I was on holiday in Sicily. And one afternoon we decided to hire a boat to go and sail round the coast. 
It started off quite nicely, it was, the sun was shining and, you know, we were sunbathing.  But then we decided to drop the anchor and stay still for a little while, 
but I didn't know that you shouldn't use the engine when the anchor is dropped.  So somehow the rope got tangled up  in the engine and the engine stopped working.</p>
